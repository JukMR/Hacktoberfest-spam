# Hacktoberfest-spam

This is most certainly a *rant* about how a lot of people misuse and degrade Hacktoberfest each year. Ridiculous amounts of spammy PRs, a lot of README edits and whatnot.  

I searched for something like this, but couldn't find anything. So, I created my own - this repo.

## Prevention

If you don't want to waste your time to make PR to a banned repository you should check out the issues of the chosen repository.

If you feel a little bit adventurous use the given basic GitHub search code below:
```
author:"hacktoberfest-team" type:"issues" 
```
(A good PR would be a search query which returns all repositories with the label "hacktoberfest" whilst checking the issues from "hacktoberfest-team")
## Contributions

Feel free to add anything, resourceful or not, maybe a rant or your disgust or whatever you like. Create a PR and I'm most likely to merge. Ironical?

## Major Changes

Until last year , any pull request valid or invalid counts towards completing the hacktoberfest challenge. But from this year , a record is being kept to check whether the pull request is valid or not. Until validated by the maintainer the pull request won't count towards challenge completion.
