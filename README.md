# Hacktoberfest-spam

This is most certainly a *rant* about how a lot of people misuse and degrade Hacktoberfest each year. Ridiculous amounts of spammy PRs, a lot of README edits and whatnot.  

I searched for something like this, but couldn't find anything. So, I created my own - this repo.

Feel free to add anything, resourceful or not, maybe a rant or your disgust or whatever you like. Create a PR and I'm most likely to merge. Ironical?
